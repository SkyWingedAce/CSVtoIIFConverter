This program was created with the exclusive purpose of converting CSV files produced by Scaletrak software 
for Harris County Georgia Solid Waste.

IF you are trying to learn how to use this tool please scroll to the "HOW TO USE" section.

To do this, this folder "CSVtoIIFConverter" Contains all folders and files needed to accomplish this.

"CSV Folder": This folder is where the program is looking for exported CSV files to convert

"IIF Folder": This Folder is where all new and old iif Files will be created and stored

"CSVFolderLocation.txt": This File contains the location that CSV Files are created and stored. 
			 Please make sure this file contains the file path of where your CSV's are located
			 also make sure that the file name follows this format "c:\\place\\"
			 the program will fail if the folders are not seperated with "\\"

"IIFFormat(example)": this file is not important to the program. However it does contain a needed iif example for programers
		      who wish to understand the file format

"iifFormat": this folder contains IMPORTANT information for creation of the iif file. 
	     Please DO NOT edit this file

HOW TO USE:

This program will run it self with little input from the user.

HOWEVER, the user will need to know the name of the CSV file they are working with 
and be able to type this information in when prompted.

For easiest operation use this tool the same day you create your report in scaletrak.

USING THE PROGRAM:

IF you are using the program the same day you produced a report you WILL NOT NEED TO TYPE ANYTHING
	A file will be avaliable for you in the "IIF Folder" when it is complete.

IF you are using the program and did not produce the Scaletrak file today you will need to type its name in
	You will be asked: 

		"Please enter the File's name (the name is probably the date it was created)\n i.e. **07082020**:"

	Please type the name of the file when you see this line.

	
	IF THE PROGRAM RESPONDS WITH:

		"Please enter the File's name (the name is probably the date it was created)\n i.e. **07082020**:"

	 AGAIN YOU HAVE EITHER NOT PRODUCED A FILE OR THE NAME OF THE FILE WAS INCORRECT OR the file is not in the specified folder location

When the following appears on screen:

	"New File created at C:\\CSVtoIIFConverter\\IIF Folder\\(filename).iif"

then the program has finished and you may now claim your .iif file for use in quick books.

Troubleshooting:

IF the program closes and no IIF file is created this usually means the program encountered an error and failed.

please double check the CSV you used for any data that is offset from the rest of the information. This program is very dumb and it can't interrperet data that does not match a pattern.
(Potential causes for this are a comma ( , ) being present in a field.) if a comma is added to a name it will think it is the start of a new column and will need to be removed.
